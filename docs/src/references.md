The semidefinite programming solver and the interface (including sampled polynomials) in `ClusteredLowRankSolver.jl` have been developed as part of the paper
 - Nando Leijenhorst and David de Laat, [*Solving clustered low-rank semidefinite programs arising from polynomial optimization*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.12077), preprint, 2022. arXiv:2202.12077
The solver was inspired by the more specialized solver
- David Simmons-Duffin. [*A semidefinite program solver for the conformal bootstrap*](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/JHEP06(2015)174). J. High Energy Phys. 174 (2015), [arXiv:1502.02033](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02033)

The rounding procedure in `ClusteredLowRankSolver.jl` has been developed as part of the paper
 - Henry Cohn, David de Laat, and Nando Leijenhorst, [*Optimality of spherical codes via exact semidefinite programming bounds*](), preprint, 2024. arXiv:???
This improves the rounding procedure developed in
- Maria Dostert, David de Laat, and Philippe Moustrou, [*Exact semidefinite programming bounds for packing problems*](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/20M1351692), SIAM J. Optim. 31(2) (2021), 1433-1458, [arXiv:2001.00256](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.00256)
