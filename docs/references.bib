	abstract = {We give a primal-dual interior point method specialized to clustered low-rank semidefinite programs, which arise from multivariate polynomial (matrix) programs through sums-of-squares characterizations and sampling. This extends the work of Simmons-Duffin [J. High Energ. Phys. 1506, no. 174 (2015)] from univariate to multivariate polynomial matrix programs and to more general clustered low-rank semidefinite programs. We study the interplay of sampling and symmetry reduction as well as a greedy method to obtain numerically good bases and sample points. We apply this to the computation of three-point bounds for the kissing number problem, for which we show a significant speedup (by a factor \$28\$ for previously computed bounds). This allows for the computation of improved kissing number bounds in dimensions \$11\$ through \$23\$. The approach performs well for problems with bad numerical conditioning, which we show through new computations for the binary sphere packing problem.},

	abstract = {We give theorems that can be used to upper bound the densities of packings of different spherical caps in the unit sphere and of translates of different convex bodies in Euclidean space. These theorems extend the linear programming bounds for packings of spherical caps and of convex bodies through the use of semideﬁnite programming. We perform explicit computations, obtaining new bounds for packings of spherical caps of two different sizes and for binary sphere packings. We also slightly improve the bounds for the classical problem of packing identical spheres.},

	abstract = {We investigate the representation of multivariate symmetric polynomials as sum of squares, as well as the effective computation of this decomposition. Since this task is solved using semidefinite programming tools we explore the geometric, algebraic, and computational implications of the presence of discrete symmetries in semidefinite programs. It is shown that symmetry exploitation allows a significant reduction in both matrix size and number of decision variables. The results, reinterpreted from an invariant-theoretic viewpoint, provide a novel representation of a class of nonnegative symmetric polynomials. For this, we introduce a common generalization of sum of squares polynomials and positive semidefinite matrices, termed “sum of squares matrices.” The main theorem states that an invariant sum of squares polynomial is a sum of inner products of pairs of matrices, whose entries are invariant polynomials. In these pairs, one of the matrices is computed based on the real irreducible representations of the group, and the other is a sum of squares matrix. The reduction techniques enable the numerical solution of large-scale instances, otherwise computationally infeasible to solve.},
